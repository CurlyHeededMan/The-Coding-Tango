#Coding studies completed today:

    6 steps completed on "Build a Hotel Feedback Form" (FreeCodeCamp) Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum
    Completed GitHub skills-introduction-to-github
    Completed Github skills-communicate-using-markdown
    Completed Github skills-github-pages (Hence why we have this shiny new site to log everything yay!)

I don't know how to code but I would like to. I never studied it in college and I've always had a strong interest in the tech industry. So I aim to self learn with online resources. Wish me luck.</ul>
