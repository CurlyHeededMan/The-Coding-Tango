<p>#Coding studies completed today:<p>

<ol><li>6 steps completed on "Build a Hotel Feedback Form" (FreeCodeCamp) Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum</li>
<li>Completed GitHub skills-introduction-to-github</li>
<li>Completed Github skills-communicate-using-markdown</li>
<li>Completed Github skills-github-pages (Hence why we have this shiny new site to log everything yay!)</li>

<p>I don't know how to code but I would like to. I never studied it in college and I've always had a strong interest in the tech industry. So I aim to self learn with online resources. Wish me luck.</p>
