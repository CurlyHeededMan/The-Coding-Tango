# Website HTML, CSS and Javascript project
Here you will find my first web development project. it will look terrible and probably make no sense but I will endeavour to work on this thing until it is half way decent. Thank you for checking it out. I started self learning coding in June 2024 so please bear with me as I pick things up as fast as I can. Reach out to me if you want to offer any tips or suggestions.
